goray
=======

goray is very much alpha quality software and not ready for production.  Many
features are missing, some things may not work right, and the behavior of the
program is not well documented.

That said, here's what you need to get goray running:

* The most recent release of the Go programming language. <http://golang.org/>
* SCons <http://www.scons.org/>
* SCons Go Tools <https://launchpad.net/sconsgo>
* The goyaml package <http://goyaml.googlecode.com/>

Build goray with::

    scons -Q debug=0

To run goray, provide a scene description file (a YAML file) as the sole
argument.  By default, goray will render to a file called ``goray.png`` in the
current directory.  For example::

    bin/goray demos/suzanne.yaml

For further help::

    bin/goray -help
